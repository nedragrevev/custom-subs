### Notes (August 2022):

If you've downloaded my subs for season 1 prior to August 2022, I highly recommend updating them. I would update them all, but I'm specifically mentioning season 1 because they had quite a few significant issues. As of August 2022, I've checked the dialogue (the right way) and fixed any and all remaining errors. They are like new subs (though I suppose if you speed read you won't notice that much of a difference). Subsequent seasons/specials didn't have as many issues, but there was the odd error or two that have now been fixed.<br/>

All of these have also had a varying amount of translation improvements. And any translation choices were consistent throughout the series. For example, the use of English honorifics with titles such as "Mr. Postman" or "the postman" depending on who the speaker was talking to. Most of the food is now rendered with their Japanese names.<br/>

I'm still not 100% satisfied with them. The various unique interjections that some of the characters repeat throughout the series could be translated better (or not at all in some cases), but I don't have the motivation to review 50+ episodes in Aegisub, and these are still a big improvement over what's available out there, officially and unofficially.<br/>

I'm confident these are 100% error-free and present really well, so give them a try.
