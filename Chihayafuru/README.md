\# Blur: \be tags remain in seasons 1 and 2. If you're viewing these at a resolution other than 1080p, the blur is likely to look wrong. If your player uses VSFilter it might be okay.<br/>For season 3, all \be tags have been removed and \blur tags have been adjusted so these episodes should render fine at resolutions other than 1080p.

## Poem translations

Only a few have been adjusted (and throughout all 3 seasons for consistency).
These adjustments make use of quite a few respected translations, while keeping the unique first verse structure that Commie had done.

Here are the poems that have been adjusted:

|Poem|Translation Used|Notes|
|--------|--------|--------|
|22|Fall it is when a gust drives the grass <br/>and the leaves off the tree<br/><br/>It is no wonder the mountain wind<br/>is called the wild destroyer|The first syllable in this poem is „Åµ (fu)<br/>which is a fricative. "Fall" is also a<br/>fricative. The importance of this is<br/>explained in S01E14 @~19m55s.|
|23|From my view of the moon<br/>a myriad of things enter my mind,<br/><br/>Filling me with melancholy,<br/>yet autumn's dejection comes not to me alone|Torifuda (grabbing card) change only.|
|32|The mountain stream...<br/><br/>By helpless autumn leaves, caught against the flow|Torifuda change only.<br/>The first verse is incomplete because<br/>this poem hasn't yet been read in full.|
|48|How like a driven wave I am,<br/>blown by the fierce winds, I crash against the rocks<br/><br/>So my heart alone is left shattered, as I think of you|S03E24|
|55|Now, though the waterfall ceased its flowing long ago<br/>and its sound is stilled,<br/><br/>Echoes are yet heard, as its fame flows on and on|Torifuda change only.|

## Other Notes

If you've previously downloaded season 1 from a few years ago, I've since made some critical changes and fixes, which includes more sensible translation choices, some other significant improvements, and the inclusion of versions without honorifics (with signs specifically adjusted to match). As of the August 2022 revisions/dialogue checks, they have been improved even further (particularly season 2).

These will work with the English dub as I've left in the poem translations with \an2 (bottom) alignment. The poem translations won't exactly match when there is dialogue between characters discussing a particular poem/card, though.

I'm not going to list everything here (because that would be boring), so if you're interested in reading about the additions and adjustments/changes in more detail, see the included readme files.

Overall, these should present really well now, and that is especially true of the August 2022 revisions/dialogue check versions. These offer an excellent alternative to what's out there officially and unofficially.
