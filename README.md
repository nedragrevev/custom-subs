# nedragrevev's English Subtitles

This repository contains all the SSA English subtitles I've worked on or fixed to match the most common anime home releases. I own all the releases/physical media of the movies and series you see here myself.<br/>
I'm retired from subbing anything new, but I will still try to maintain these if necessary, so I'm happy to take onboard (and would welcome) any feedback, suggestions or constructive criticism.

### July & August 2022 Update

Every release here (with the exception of *orange*) has had a complete dialogue check by reading every single dialogue line in a text editor (Notepad++). It's the first time I've used this method to check for errors in dialogue, and it's extremely reliable, even with relatively insignificant and inconspicuous (when watching) grammatical issues.<br/>
I highly recommend updating to these latest updates. Many of these have been improved significantly when compared to previous versions I've released where a dialogue check was not done.<br/>
I'm confident these subs, as they stand now, present really well in all areas, so they are highly likely to be the final releases, but any feedback is, of course, still welcome.

## My goals

- Timing: All lines manually retimed (or checked and adjusted) with careful thought given to how it presents.
- Typesetting: Realistic.
- Songs: Appropriate karaoke effects where it works (fades sometimes look more professional). Translation adjustments so the lyrics actually make sense (and still reflect the JP).
- Translation: Honorifics and sensible unlocalized translations preferred where it works (with the rare translation note if required).<br/>Interjections added back in if it looks better.<br/>No expletives. Of course, the lines will still convey the emotions (and characteristics) of the speaker.<br/>As for the translation itself, I usually make some careful adjustments to improve translation accuracy and naturalness when required. If I think it's desperately needed and it's not 20+ episodes (or typeset heavy), I will probably check and re-translate every line.<br/>If it's an option, I'll do research to see if whatever I'm translating exists in the real world, and translate accordingly (especially when a sign is hard to make out or the kanji has multiple readings).
- Dialog: Cabin SemiBold @ font size 68. I favor manually adding line breaks at the most natural places if possible (I can get this wrong but I do my best). Some of my earlier work leans towards simply breaking at a centered position, though.

These releases include signs and songs only versions if the BD's I own have English dubs. With a few exceptions, these versions have been adjusted to remove honorifics and any other differences. For example, VE's English dub has a few insert songs not present in the original Japanese dubbing.

\# TARI TARI Typesetting: No longer happy with the typesetting but I'm not planning to ever revise this. It still offers something decent over what's currently out there.

## How to use these files
Use MKVToolNix's "Multiplexer" tab to combine/mux your encode with the relevant ".ass" sub file/s (required), all fonts (required), chapter xml if applicable, and cover image if desired. Once started, the muxing process is as fast as your HDD, so in some cases it will only take a second or two.
