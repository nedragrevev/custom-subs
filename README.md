# nedragrevev's English Subtitles

This repository contains all the SSA English subtitles I've worked on or fixed to match the most common anime home releases. I own all the releases/physical media of the movies and series you see here myself.<br/>

### July 2022 Updates

Every release here (with the exception of *orange*) has been quickly but thoroughly checked through for any grammatical errors by reading every single line of dialogue in a text editor.<br/>
I highly recommend updating to these latest updates. Many of these have been improved significantly when compared to versions prior to these checks.<br/>
I'm confident that these releases, as they stand now, present well in all areas, so what you see here now are probably the final releases (and I'm not subbing anymore, so there won't be anything new). Feedback is still welcome, though.

## My goals

- Timing: All lines manually retimed (or checked and adjusted) with careful thought given to how it presents.
- Typesetting: Realistic.
- Songs: Appropriate karaoke effects where it works. Translation adjustments so the lyrics actually make sense (and still reflect the JP).
- Translation: Natural and accurate (not just script changes but actual translation work was done).<br/>Honorifics and sensible unlocalized translations (with the rare translation note where required).<br/>Interjections added back in where it looked better.<br/>No expletives, but the lines still convey the emotions (and characteristics) of the speaker.<br/>As for the translation itself, careful adjustments to improve translation accuracy and naturalness have been made. Where I felt it was desperately needed, I've checked and re-translated every line.<br/>For onscreen text/sign translations, in some cases I've done a bit of research to look at the sign in the real world and then translated accordingly (where a sign is hard to make out or the kanji has multiple readings).
- Dialog: Cabin SemiBold @ font size 68. I favor manually adding line breaks at the most natural places if possible (I can get this wrong but I've done my best). Some of my earlier work leans towards simply breaking at a centered position, though.

These releases include signs and songs only versions if the BD's I own have English dubs. With a few exceptions, these versions have been adjusted to remove honorifics and any other differences. For example, VE's English dub has a few insert songs not present in the original Japanese dubbing.

\# TARI TARI Typesetting: I'm no longer happy with the typesetting, but I'm not planning to ever revise this. It still offers something decent over what's currently out there.

## How to use these files
Use MKVToolNix's "Multiplexer" tab to combine/mux your encode with the relevant ".ass" sub file/s (required), all fonts (required), chapter xml if applicable, and cover image if desired. Once started, the muxing process is as fast as your HDD, so in some cases it will only take a second or two.
